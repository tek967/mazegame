# The Maze game (by easontek2398)

An old scratch game brought back to life in python and mandaw. Enjoy!

## Contributing

Anyone who has experience with mandaw can contribute. Fork and pull request, review should be done in about 1-2 days.
Mandaw is based on PySDL2, so anyone who knows pygame or pysdl2 would find this very easy to learn. 

## Packages available

None yet! wait for packages to be released.
There should be nuitka/pyinstaller distributables somewhere later on.
